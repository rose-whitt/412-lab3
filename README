This archive contains a stripped down version of the auto-grader for COMP 412
Lab 3 -- the local instruction scheduler.

To complete installation, you need to change the definition of base_dir in
the file auto_grade/auto_grade.py. It should hold the pathname to the directory
where this README file resides.  (Use pwd to check the naem if you are unsure.) 
The base_dire string must end in a slash.

To test your installation, invoke RunGrader with the two test tar files that
come installed in the directory ./TarFileGoesHere.  That should run the grader
on lab3_ref with and without graph simplification.

To test your submission, place your archive in ./TarFileGoesHere and invoke
RunGrader. 

To double check that neither your code nor your scripts need access to the 
files in your directory structure, I would install l3ag outside of the file
system subtree where your code normally lives.  I would temporarily change
the permission on the directory where you developed your submission:

    chmod 000 my-lab-3-directory

and run the auto-grader. You can change the permissions back after the test 

    chmod 700 my-lab-3-directory

(or whatever permissions you use).
