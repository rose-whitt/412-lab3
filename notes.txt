run reference to get scheduled code: ~comp412/students/lab3/lab3_ref -s -g ./dgslide4.i >> scheduled_dgslide4_ref.i
run the scheduled code against simulator: ./lab3/sim -t -s 1 ./scheduled_dgslide4_ref.i >> sim_scheduled_dgslide4.i
run the original (not scheduled) code against simulator: ./lab3/sim -t -s 3 ./dgslide4.i >> sim_notscheduled_dgslide.i

compare simulator's scheduled output (sim_scheduled_dgslide4.i) vs original output (sim_notscheduled_dgslide.i)

in the lab3 directory in clear: ./lab3_ref report/report01.i | ./sim -t -s 1

debugging:
    With the scheduler, you need to compare the behavior of the scheduled code against the behavior of the unscheduled code.
            Use
                    “sim -t -s 1 …” on the scheduled code
                and
                    “sim -t -s 3 … “ on the unscheduled code.
        You want to find the first place where an operation in the scheduled code produces a different value than the same operation
         in the original code. Then, figure out why it was getting different operands. 
         From that, what scheduling error could have caused the error.
        Inside the scheduler, I typically look at the READY and ACTIVE sets and how the various operations
        move into and out of those sets. Paying attention to how something gets into and out of those sets usually
         leads to insights into the error.
