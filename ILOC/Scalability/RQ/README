These blocks were designed to allow a user to measure the change in running time 
of a COMP 412 Lab 3 scheduler as a function of the average size of the ready set
(or "ready queue").

The file name shows the expected ready set size.

Each block is 64,000 lines in length. The blocks are long enough to establish the
scheduler's behavior. They are of uniform length so that the timing differences
should lie (at least primarily) in the handling of the ready set.
