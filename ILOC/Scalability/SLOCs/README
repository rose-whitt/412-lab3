Blocks used in the various timing tests to measure scalability as a function 
of total lines of input code. Each block has a couple of loadI operations, 
a lot of add operations, one store, and one output. The blocks are designed
so that they have a demand for 20 registers (e.g., MaxLive = 20) and an 
average Ready Queue length of 19. Thus, they really measure dependence on 
input size -- that is, they hold register demand (lab 2), dependence graph 
size (lab 3), and queue lengths (lab 3) uniform as the code gets longer.
